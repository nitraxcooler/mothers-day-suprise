  <h1>Happy Mother's Day, Mama!</h1>
  <div class="heart">&hearts;</div>
  <p style="animation-delay: 2s">
    Mama,
    if I could paint the sky with words, I'd still never find enough space to describe how much you mean to me.
    You've given me the gift of life, but even more than that, you've given me love, strength, and endless support.
  </p>
  <p style="animation-delay: 4s">
    I remember your warm hugs, your gentle voice when I was scared, your patience when I was stubborn, and your belief in me when I didn't believe in myself.
    You are the reason I stand tall, dream big, and love deeply.
  </p>
  <p style="animation-delay: 6s">
    There are moments I didn’t say thank you.
    There are days I didn’t show how much I care.
    But please know, Mama — every heartbeat of mine is filled with love for you.
  </p>
  <p style="animation-delay: 8s">
    Thank you for the sacrifices you made in silence.
    For the tears you held back, the dreams you put on pause, and the battles you fought with a smile on your face — just so I could grow in peace and comfort.
  </p>
  <p style="animation-delay: 10s">
    You are not just my mother — you are my home, my peace, my guide, and my eternal light.
    I love you more than this page can hold, more than time itself.
  </p>
  <p style="animation-delay: 12s">
    Happy Mother's Day, Mama. I hope today and every day, you feel just how deeply you are loved.
    Forever your child.
    From, Halley.
  </p>
